## Introduction

[`kilo`](http://antirez.com/news/108) is a text editor written by antirez. I'm just astounded at how concise this is, it's extremely interesting and educational for me. So I decided to write it in different programming languages (`C`, `Python`, `Golang`), and also plan to use it as a toy project to learn new languages (`Rust`).

## Credits

The C code is written using the [kilo tutorial](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-tutorial).
